# :newspaper: News Scraper 
## *A web application that lets users leave comments on the latest news from Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters.*

> When a user utilizes the News Scraper website, this app will scrape the latest news headlines from Slashdot. Both News Scraper and the CLI will output data that includes the headline and link to each article. Cheerio grabs the site content and Mongoose saves it to the News Scraper MongoDB database. All users can leave comments to the articles collected and can delete whatever comments they want removed. Stored comments are visible to all users. Mongoose's model system associates comments with particular articles.
