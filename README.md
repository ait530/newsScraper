> When the user visits the site, this app will scrape the stories from the Economist. Data will include a link to the story and headline. Cheerio grabs the site content and Mongoose saves it to a MongoDB database. All users can leave comments to the stories collected and can delete whatever comments they want removed. Comments are visible to all users. Mongoose's model system assoicates comments with particular articles.
